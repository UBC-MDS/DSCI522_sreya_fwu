### Chicago Crimes Dataset
We are going to analyze the Chicago crimes dataset that reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2016 to 2017. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.
Essentially, this dataset contains the type of Crime, Location, Sub Category of the Crime, Type of Vicinity and Whether the arrest was possible or not.

The dataset includes the following contents:

| Column name | datatype | Description |
| --- | -- | -- |
| ID | Numeric | Identifier for a particular case of crime |
| Case Number | String | Case number with the police | 
| Date | Date | Date and time at which the crime occured | 
| Block | String | Block where the crime occured | 
| IUCR | Numeric | Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting |
| Primary Type | String | Type of crime |
| Description | String | Description of the crime |
| Location Description | String | Location of the crime |
| Arrest | Boolean | Whether an arrest was made | 
| Domestic | Boolean | Whether it is a domestic violence case | 
| Beat | Numeric | -- | 
| District | Numeric | Disrict where the crime occured | 
| Ward | Numeric | Ward where the crime occured | 
| Community Area | Numeric | Community area where the crime occured |
| FBI Code | Numeric | FBI code for the crime |
| X Coordinate | Numeric | Loaction co-ordinates of the crime |
| Y Coordinate | Numeric | Loaction co-ordinates of the crime |
| Year | Numeric | Year when the crime occured | 
| Updated On | Date | Time and date when the investigation for the crime was updated | 
| Latitude | Numeric | Loaction co-ordinates of the crime | 
| Longitude | Numeric | Loaction co-ordinates of the crime |
| Location | String | Location of the crime |


We wrote a script to download the dataset as follows:

### Research Question

**What are the strongest predictors of an arrest result for a crime in Chicago?**

#### Type of question

This is a **predictive** question and we shall use a Decision Tree to answer the same.

### Data Analysis Plan

The goal of this analysis is to explore the Chicago Crimes Dataset from 2016-2017, classify the features that determine the arrest result, and construct a predictive model to identify whether an arrest could happen for a future crime. The detailed steps for this analysis are:

Step 1. Load data into Python

Step 2. Data wrangling:

- Checking missing values
- Dealing with null values
- Cleaning the description column with standard keywords
- Putting the arrest and domestic columns into 1 (True) or 0 (False)
- Separating the date and time into two columns.

Step 3. Visualizations of the dataset:

- The numer of crimes reported in the 2 years
- Location with the highest crime rate
- Crime trend among 2016-2017
- Summary of the arrest results

Step 4. Prediction Model: 

In this analysis, we will apply the decision tree method to find the strongest features that are able to predict the arrest result.

- Separate the dataset into training and testing datasets (7:3).
- Define the variable X to be a feature vector that includes the time of the crime, primary type (category of the crime), description, location, and domestic (if it was a domestic crime).
- Define the target variable Y to be the arrest result. 
- Use the decision tree package in Python (i.e. Scikit Learn) to model the relationship between X and Y. 
- Once we get the tree, we can use it to get the predicted arrest results for the testing dataset and compare them with the actual results to get the accuracy rate.


### Experimental Results

To present our result, we will draw the entire tree as we considered five features and indicate the strongest predictors chosen by this method. Additionally, we will report the classification error.
